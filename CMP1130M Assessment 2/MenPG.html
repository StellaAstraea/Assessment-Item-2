			<p id="des_man_1">The Chuck Taylor All Star high top is the most iconic sneaker in the world, recognised for its unmistakable silhouette, star-centred ankle patch and cultural authenticity. And like the best paradigms, it only gets better with time. For generations, these classic colours and the quality rubber vulcanised sole have defined an icon. Born on the court but adopted by rebels, rockers, rappers, artists, dreamers, thinkers and originals, the Chuck Taylor All Star continues to celebrate personal style and individual self-expression.</p>

			<p id="des_man_2">The Converse All Star Chuck ’70 is our re-crafted sneaker that uses modern details to celebrate the original Chuck Taylor All Star from the 1970s. It features a slightly higher rubber foxing, a cushioned footbed that provides long-lasting comfort and a more substantial rubber toe cap. Additional vintage details include stitching on the sidewall and a heavier-grade canvas upper for comfort and durability. They join iconic Chuck Taylor attributes such as the star-centred ankle patch and vulcanised rubber outsole.</p>

			<img id="con_man_3" src="Assets/resizedThird.jpg" alt="Italian Made">
			<p id="des_man_3">Introducing a fresh new Italian Crafted Dye Collection. The collection is centered around things you’d probably find in an Italian Kitchen: Wine, Coffee, Turmeric, and Chocolate. The footwear and apparel go through a high temperature dying ECO-friendly process as the pigments from the food are extracted into the garments. Each piece in the collection is dyed in Italy using carefully selected ingredients.</p>
